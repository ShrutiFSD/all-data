    <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>

    <p>
    <h3>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</h3><br /> <u>(2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)</u> was an Indian lawyer,
    anti-colonial
    nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign</br> for
    India's independence from British rule. </br>He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
    The
    honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable),<br> first applied to him in South Africa in
    1914, is now used throughout the world.</p>
    </br>
    <p><mark>Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat</mark>, Gandhi trained in the law at the </br>Inner
        Temple in London
        and was called to the bar at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India</br>, where he was unable to
        start a
        successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa</br> in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit.
        He
        went on to live in South Africa for 21 years.<br> Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent
        resistance in a campaign for civil right</br>s. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about
        organising
        peasants, farmers,</br> and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land tax.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as
        the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial
        India. During India's nationalist movement and in several decades immediately after,</p>

    <i>he was also commonly called
        Bapu, an endearment roughly meaning "father".</i>
